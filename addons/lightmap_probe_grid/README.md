# How to install
Extract the `addons` folder on the root of your project (`res://`). Go to "Project" menu -> "Project Settings" -> "Plugins" tab -> enable "LightmapProbeGrid" and restart Godot.

You can also open the `DemoProject` to see how it works.

# Making a grid of Light Probes
Place the LightmapProbeGrid Node in the scene. It's located at "Add Node" -> Node3D -> LightmapProbeGrid.
Use the handle (red dots) to resize the grid.
In the LightmapProbeGrid Inspector, you can set the number of Light Probes on each axis, with the minimum of 2. Press "Generate Probes" to apply the settings and place your grid of Light Probes in the Scene.

Now you can cut unwanted probes with the methods bellow.

# Cut Probes Based on Colliders
Currently you can only cut probes based on objects that have colliders attached. This is because the tool relies on Raycast.

## Cut Obstructed
This method is designed to cut probes that are placed beyond collider limits, such as the ground or the walls of a cave. 

On LightmapProbeGrid Inscpector, click on "Cut Obstructed Probes". It will test each Light Probe from the center of the grid to the probe and see if the line intercepts the tagged object. If there's something blocking, the probe will be cut.

## Cut probes inside objects
This method is designed to delete probes that are inside objects with colliders. It will test all 6 axis of each Light Probes: Up, Down, Left, Right, Forward and Backward. 

If 4 o these hit the same object the probe will be cut. It test only 4 axis to cut probes on long objects like pillars and trees.

## Cut probes far from objects
This method is designed to delete probes that are far away from any collider. Normally these probes don't contain any relevant light information, but use with care in places that have a high usage spotlights.

When you click the button, the area around the Light Probe is tested on various directions. If none of these rays intercept an object, the probe will be cut.

## Using masks
You can select which layers the rays will interact on the Collision Mask section. Only selected layers will be used on detection for the Cut methods above.

# Limitations
LightmapProbeGrid is not designed to work with a huge number of Light Probes at once covering a vast area. It is designed to be placed various times in a scene, with relatively small grids (less than 1,000 probes).

Cutting probes relies on raycast, which only works on object that have a collider. If the object doesnâ€™t have a collider, it will not be tested for the cut.

# Compatibility
LightmapProbeGrid is compatible with Godot 4.2 and there are plans to continue supporting onward.

# Ending notes
This tool was entirely made on my free time. If you want to support me, please make an awesome asset and publish for free to the community!
